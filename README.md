# UBC Course Schedule API


## API
Express API that serves course schedule data.

## Web Crawler
Connects to UBC Course Info page and scrapes the content of course schedules.
These data are then processed and consumed by UBC Scheduler.

## No Alternative
There is UBC Course API, but it soon proved to be unreliable with several requests being rejected.
There is no official API provided by UBC.
Thus, I built this API.

## Legality
This API and UBC Scheduler do not store any of information fetched from UBC Web Page.
This API and UBC Scheudler retrieve the information and present to students only.

## Future Work
I wish this API will not exist in future. 
I wish UBC can provide more reliable and official way for students to develope projects that can help UBC and its students.
